## EMAIL 1: COLD OUTREACH TO SOC MANAGERS

**Subject:** Save Your SOC Team 7.5 Hours Per Day

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Agency/Company] is hiring for SOC analysts on USAJobs/LinkedIn. I'm guessing you're dealing with the same challenge we all face: analysts spending too much time switching between MITRE, NVD, and CISA to investigate threats.

I built something that might help.

It's a unified threat intelligence platform that combines:
• MITRE ATT&CK (835 techniques)
• CVE Database (13,997+ vulnerabilities)
• CISA KEV (1,089 active exploits)

One question → complete intelligence in 30 seconds.

**Real example:**
Instead of checking 3 websites for 45 minutes, your analyst asks: "What are the most critical actively exploited Windows vulnerabilities?" and gets prioritized, AI-powered recommendations instantly.

For a 10-person SOC, that's **$234K/year in time savings** ($18K/year cost = 1,202% ROI).

Plus, it automatically handles CISA BOD 22-01 KEV compliance.

**Would you be open to a 15-minute demo?** I can show you exactly how it works with your specific use cases.

Live demo available here: [your-railway-url]
(Feel free to try it yourself first)

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title]
[Phone]

P.S. I'm a cleared government contractor working in this space daily. I built this for ourselves first because we had the same problem.

## EMAIL 2: FOLLOW-UP AFTER DEMO

**Subject:** Thanks for the demo - Next steps?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for taking the time for the demo yesterday. I enjoyed hearing about [specific thing they mentioned - their KEV compliance challenges/their incident response process/etc.].

Quick recap of what we covered:
• Unified search across MITRE/CVE/KEV (30 sec vs 45 min)
• AI-powered prioritization with visual alerts
• $234K annual savings for your team size
• CISA BOD 22-01 compliance built-in

You mentioned wanting to [specific need they mentioned]. I've thought about that more and here's how we can address it:

[Specific solution to their need - maybe a custom integration, specific filter, etc.]

**Next steps:**

Option 1: 30-day pilot in your environment
• Full access for your team
• Dedicated onboarding
• No commitment required

Option 2: Start with free 14-day trial
• Up to 5 users
• See results immediately
• Upgrade if it works for you

Which sounds better for [Agency/Company]?

I can get you started this week if you'd like.

Best,
[Your Name]

## EMAIL 3: WARM INTRO (SOMEONE YOU KNOW)

**Subject:** Built something for SOC teams - would love your feedback

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Hope you're doing well! I know you're knee-deep in [mention their work - threat hunting/incident response/etc.] over at [Agency/Company].

I've been building something that I think could save your team a ton of time. It's a unified threat intelligence platform that combines MITRE ATT&CK, CVE, and CISA KEV in one AI-powered system.

Instead of checking 3 different websites to investigate threats, your analysts just ask questions and get complete, prioritized intelligence in 30 seconds.

**Example query:** "What are critical actively exploited vulnerabilities affecting our Windows infrastructure?"

**Result:** AI-powered answer with:
• CISA KEV items (red pulsing badges for active exploits)
• Related CVEs with CVSS scores
• MITRE techniques used in exploitation
• Specific remediation recommendations

It's already saving us ~7.5 hours per analyst per day.

**Could I get 15 minutes on your calendar for a quick demo?** I'd love your feedback before I take this to market. You know this space better than anyone.

Try it yourself first if you want: [your-railway-url]

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. Also handles CISA BOD 22-01 compliance automatically, which I know you're dealing with.

## EMAIL 4: RE-ENGAGEMENT (SOMEONE WHO WENT COLD)

**Subject:** Quick update on the SOC intelligence platform

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick check-in - we talked a few [weeks/months] ago about the unified threat intelligence platform for SOC teams.

I wanted to let you know we've added some major new features based on customer feedback:

• [New feature 1 - e.g., Slack integration for KEV alerts]
• [New feature 2 - e.g., PDF export for compliance reports]
• [New feature 3 - e.g., SIEM integration with Splunk]

We also just signed [Customer Name/Type - e.g., "a major defense contractor"] who's seeing exactly the time savings we projected.

**Still interested in exploring this for [Agency/Company]?**

If the timing wasn't right before, I understand. But if the challenge is still there (analysts wasting time switching between MITRE/NVD/CISA), let's chat for 15 minutes.

I can show you the new features and specifically how it would work for your use cases.

Best,
[Your Name]

## EMAIL 5: VALUE-BASED (FOCUS ON ROI)

**Subject:** $234K annual savings for your SOC team

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much time do your SOC analysts spend investigating threats across MITRE ATT&CK, NVD, and CISA KEV?

If it's like most teams, it's about 45 minutes per investigation, 5-10 times per day.

For a 10-person SOC, that's **7.5 hours wasted daily** just switching between tools and manually correlating data.

At a loaded cost of $125/hour, that's **$234,375 per year** in analyst time.

**What if you could cut that to 30 seconds?**

I built a unified threat intelligence platform that does exactly that:
• Searches MITRE, CVE, and KEV simultaneously
• AI-powered correlation and prioritization
• Visual alerts for active exploits
• CISA BOD 22-01 compliance built-in

**Cost:** $18,000/year for 10 users
**Savings:** $234,375/year
**ROI:** 1,202%
**Payback period:** 28 days

**15-minute demo?** I'll show you the exact time savings with your specific use cases.

Live demo: [your-railway-url]

[Your Name]
[Phone]

P.S. I know procurement cycles can be long. We offer month-to-month SaaS - no long-term contracts required. Try it for 30 days and see the results.

## EMAIL 6: COMPLIANCE-FOCUSED (FOR FEDERAL)

**Subject:** CISA BOD 22-01 compliance in 5 minutes

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

CISA BOD 22-01 requires federal agencies to track Known Exploited Vulnerabilities and meet specific remediation deadlines.

**The manual way:**
• Check CISA KEV catalog daily (15 min)
• Map KEVs to your asset inventory (30 min)
• Track remediation deadlines (20 min)
• Report to leadership (25 min)
• **Total: 90 minutes daily per analyst**

**The automated way:**
"What KEVs affect our infrastructure?"
→ AI-powered answer with prioritized list, affected systems, and deadline countdown
→ **Time: 30 seconds**

I built a platform specifically for this. It combines:
• CISA KEV catalog (auto-updated)
• CVE database for context
• MITRE ATT&CK for technique mapping
• AI analysis for prioritization

**Handles BOD 22-01 compliance automatically.**

Plus, it saves your team $234K/year in analyst time.

**Want to see it in action?** 15-minute demo, your schedule.

Or try it yourself: [your-railway-url]

## EMAIL 7: TECHNICAL DECISION MAKER

**Subject:** Technical architecture review - Unified threat intel platform

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

[Context - how you know them or why you're reaching out]

I built a unified threat intelligence platform that you might find architecturally interesting. Key technical specs:

**Stack:**
• FastAPI backend (Python)
• Vector database (ChromaDB with sentence transformers)
• Claude Sonnet 4 for analysis
• Semantic search across 15,000+ threat indicators
• Docker containerized

**Data Sources:**
• MITRE ATT&CK (GitHub STIX format)
• NVD CVE database (REST API)
• CISA KEV catalog (JSON feed)

**Architecture:**
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system with:
• Real-time ingestion from authoritative sources
• Vector embeddings for semantic similarity
• CVSS-based prioritization
• Sub-second query response time

**Deployment:**
• Cloud (Railway, AWS, Azure)
• On-premise (air-gapped for classified)
• Docker Compose or Kubernetes
• REST API for integrations

**Use Case:**
SOC analysts query unified database instead of checking 3 separate websites. AI correlates MITRE techniques with CVEs and active exploits (KEV).

Time savings: 45 min → 30 sec per query.

**Would you be interested in a technical deep-dive?**

I can walk through the architecture, show the API docs, and discuss integration options with your existing SIEM/SOC tools.

You're [X days] into your 14-day trial. How's it going?

**Quick questions:**
• Have your analysts been able to use it?
• Are you seeing the time savings we discussed?
• Any features you wish we had?

**Common early feedback:**

"Our junior analysts love having AI explain the context."
"Saved us 2 hours on a ransomware investigation."

**Need any help?**
• Training session for your team?
• Custom queries for your use cases?
• Integration with your existing tools?

I'm here to make sure you get value from this.

**If it's working for you**, we can convert you to a paid plan anytime. Month-to-month, cancel anytime.
